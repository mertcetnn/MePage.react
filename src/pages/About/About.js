            I currently reside in and work as a New Developer from Albany. Prior
            to switching to developer, I worked in management and tourism in my
            early career. For Bootcamp, I joined Colombia Enginering. My ability
            to develop new things and new paths for our future is the best
            aspect of my profession. Although I tend to be a bit lazy, I always
            work hard and do my best. I enjoy going to the gym, spending time
            with seniors, and trying to enhance my new skills.
